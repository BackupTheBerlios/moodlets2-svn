LIB.PHP:
*   ical_parse
    should call to ical_upcoming_events
    receive a object with all events
    call ical_event and decide what to write
    write it down to a ical file
    
*   ical_upcoming_events
    should call a function in calendar, what will process all events
    create the object with all events
    return to ical_parse
    
*   ical_event
    given an object, will decide which kind of object it is, and process it
    
NOTES:
who should write: ical_event or ical_parse?
future features (or not so future ;)):
* ability the let the admin set how to update the ical file (cron or after an insert)
* maybe some kind of custom set up in the ical file (like author or course title)
