Installation
------------
1.- Copy 'lang' and 'mod' to the moodle directory.
2.- If you haven't done this, create a 'webdav' directory inside the moodle dir. If you want to give the users the ability to synchronize their calendar software with your moodle site, give that folder the required rights to WebDAV access.


Configuration
-------------
You can only change the folder where the iCal files will be placed, this can be done using the module configuration panel.
